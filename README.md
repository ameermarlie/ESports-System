# ESports-System
An Esports Web Application that allows coaches and players to colaborate to achieve optimum performance in gaming tournaments.
This project is a server-side web application that my team and I developed as our 2024 capstone project. We partnered with Centennial Gaming School to create a comprehensive platform for learners (players) and teachers (coaches). The website enables users to log in, host tournaments, share announcements, and more. One standout feature allows coaches to retrieve player stats directly from games like Fortnite and Overwatch, helping them make informed team selections. Our tech stack included Java, Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and SQL, ensuring a robust and dynamic user experience.
